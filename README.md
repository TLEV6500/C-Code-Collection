# C-Code-Collection
Personal C Code Collection

Hello, visitor! This is my personal collection of C programs and snippets that I've written throughout the course of my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I am keeping them here as a sort of reference and a memoir so to speak of my journey. Almost all of the programs that I've coded as solutions to homeworks, quizzes, exams, and competitions (if memory allows) will be pushed here. For my fellow CIT-U BSCS or even BSIT students, please feel free to look at my solutions to the problems that you also may encounter. Just don't copy it as it is. Understand the process, and use that understanding to formulate your own solutions.

The programs/snippets here might not be optimal, as they are just what I came up with to solve the particular problems within the given time. Either that, or a revised version that I made as a review or an attempt at optimization after the said problem was submitted or initially solved. But I will commit changes to the code if I see an optimization could be made with the approach I took. I could also make multiple solutions to the same problem if I can think of multiple, distinct approaches--if I have the time that is.
